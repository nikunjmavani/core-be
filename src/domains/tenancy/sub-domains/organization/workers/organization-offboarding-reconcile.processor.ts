 *
 * @remarks
 * - **Algorithm:** under the global-retention cleanup context (no per-tenant RLS),
 *   selects up to `ORGANIZATION_OFFBOARDING_RECONCILE_BATCH` non-PERSONAL rows where
 *   `deletion_started_at` is older than `ORGANIZATION_OFFBOARDING_STUCK_AFTER_MINUTES`
 *   and `deleted_at IS NULL`, then calls `resumeOffboarding` per row OUTSIDE that scan
 *   context (the service opens its own org transactions + does Stripe/S3 I/O). The
 *   offboarding is idempotent, so a partial run resumes and completes (sets
 *   `deleted_at`), dropping out of the next scan.
 * - **Failure modes:** a per-row failure is counted, warn-logged, and reported to
 *   Sentry; the row stays for the next tick. Scan errors propagate to BullMQ
 *   retry / DLQ.
 * - **Side effects:** drives logo/upload cleanup, subscription cancel, soft-delete,
 *   and permission-cache purge per stuck row.
 * - **Notes:** PERSONAL organizations are excluded (never deletable standalone);
 *   scheduled (cron) via `infrastructure/queue/scheduler.ts`.
