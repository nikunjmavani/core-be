 * role→membership join with no owner shortcut).
 *
 * @remarks
 * - **Algorithm:** pre-generates the org `public_id` and runs every insert inside one
 *   `withOrganizationDatabaseContext(publicId, …)` transaction, so `app.current_organization_id`
 *   equals the org being created. The org row then satisfies its tenant-isolation WITH CHECK
 *   (`public_id = app.current_organization_id`) and the child rows (roles, role_permissions,
 *   memberships) satisfy theirs (`organization_id` → the just-inserted org) — all under the
 *   non-superuser `core_be_app` role with NO admin escape hatch (the tenancy policies do not honor
 *   `app.global_admin`; only `auth`/`audit` do, which is why the former global-admin path failed
 *   its WITH CHECK with 42501 in deployed environments). One transaction keeps the owner-bootstrap
 *   atomic — a partial failure can never leave an org whose owner has no access. TEAM
 *   organizations additionally insert the default {@link DEFAULT_TEAM_ROLES}
 *   (Admin/Member/Viewer) and their grants so a new team can assign a role and invite members
 *   immediately; PERSONAL organizations get Owner only. This is a server-side bootstrap only;
 *   the inputs are not user-controlled beyond name/slug/type.
 * - **Failure modes:** the whole transaction rolls back on any insert failure (unique slug,
 *   one-personal-per-owner index, missing permission reference rows). Callers map
 *   `unique_violation` to a 409.
 * - **Side effects:** table inserts (organizations, roles, role_permissions, memberships); TEAM
 *   organizations additionally insert the default Admin/Member/Viewer roles and their grants.
 * - **Notes:** the owner and default roles are `is_system: true` so they cannot be deleted via the
 *   role API. Permission reference rows (the `permissions` table) are assumed seeded — they are
 *   reference data present in every environment.
