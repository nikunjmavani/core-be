/**
 * Orchestrates the login/active-organization lookups under the caller's own user RLS context. The
 * SQL lives in {@link OrganizationRepository}; these helpers only choose the context and map the
 * repository's `null` to `undefined` for their callers.
 *
 * @remarks
 * - **RLS:** every tenancy lookup runs under {@link withUserDatabaseContext} via
 *   {@link withUserContextForInternalId}, which sets `app.current_user_id` so the
 *   `organizations_user_discovery` / `memberships_user_self_discovery` policies (migration
 *   `20260520000004`) match the caller's own rows. These reads must NOT run under the
 *   global-admin context: `tenancy.organizations` and `tenancy.memberships` are
 *   FORCE RLS and their policies honor only `app.current_organization_id` and `app.current_user_id`
 *   — never `app.global_admin` (only the `auth.*` and `audit.logs` policies carry that arm). Under
 *   the admin context every policy evaluates false and the memberships → organizations join returns
 *   zero rows, stranding users on the onboarding wizard once the login role lost BYPASSRLS.
 *   `provisionOrganization` was corrected for the same reason on the write side; this is the
 *   matching read-side fix.
 * - **Side effects:** none (read-only).

 *
 * Returns `undefined` when the internal id resolves to no live user, so callers degrade to

 *
 * @remarks
 * The resolver replaces a `withGlobalAdminDatabaseContext` wrapper. That wrapper worked — the

 * on a self-service login path (the same objection recorded in `provisionOrganization`) and cost a
