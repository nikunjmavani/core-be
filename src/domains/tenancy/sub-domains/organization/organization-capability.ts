 * Guards a team-only capability: rejects with 422 when `organization` is a

 * @throws UnprocessableEntityError When the organization is PERSONAL — the org
 *   `type` is immutable, so retrying the identical request can never succeed
 *   (422 `unprocessable_entity`, not 409).
 *
 * @remarks
 * - **Algorithm:** if `type === 'PERSONAL'`, throw `UnprocessableEntityError`
 *   keyed by {@link CAPABILITY_REJECTION_KEY}; otherwise no-op.
 * - **Failure modes:** PERSONAL organization ⇒ 422 `unprocessable_entity`.
 * - **Side effects:** none (pure guard; throws or returns).
 * - **Notes:** single point of enforcement for the personal-vs-team rule, shared by
 *   member-invitation, membership (add member / transfer ownership), member-role,
 *   organization delete, and subscription billing (create / change-plan / cancel /
 *   resume). Team-only affordances are NOT advertised on the API response; a client
 *   derives them from the organization `type` and gates the action itself on the
 *   caller's permissions (e.g. `subscription:manage`).
