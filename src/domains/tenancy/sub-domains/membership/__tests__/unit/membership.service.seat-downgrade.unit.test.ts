/**
 * `suspendExcessActiveMembersToFitCeiling` (REQ-4 F2) is billing's post-downgrade entry point: when
 * a plan change lowers the seat ceiling below the live active-member count, it suspends the excess.
 * It had ZERO test references repo-wide. The load-bearing invariants — excess = used - ceiling, the
 * OWNER is never suspended (self-lockout), and each suspended member's permission cache is purged —
 * were entirely unasserted, so a bug could silently over/under-suspend or lock the owner out.
