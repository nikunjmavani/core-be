 *   (`syncFromStripeProviderSubscription`, `markCanceledByStripeProviderSubscriptionId`)
 *   accept a repository override so the webhook worker can pass its own
 *   worker-scoped handle.
 * - **Failure modes:** Throws {@link NotFoundError} when the organization,
 *   plan, or subscription cannot be loaded. The mutating operations (`create` /
 *   `changePlan` / `cancel` / `resume`) first reject a PERSONAL organization with
 *   422 via `assertTeamOrganization(organization, 'BILLING')` — billing is a
 *   team-only action (a PERSONAL organization cannot manage billing). On `create`, throws
 *   {@link ConflictError} (`errors:subscriptionAlreadyExists`) when the
 *   organization already has a non-terminal subscription (checked before the
 *   Stripe call) or when a concurrent create loses the partial-unique-index
 *   race (Postgres `unique_violation`, `23505`). The payment provider is
 *   **fail-closed**: a Stripe failure on `create` / `cancel` / `resume` /
 *   `changePlan` surfaces as `ServiceUnavailableError` from the provider, which
 *   runs *before* any local write, so no local subscription row is created or
 *   mutated when the provider call fails — the Stripe webhook stays the
 *   reconciliation source of truth. If persistence fails *after* the Stripe
 *   create succeeded, the provider is rolled back via `compensateFailedCreate`.
 *   On `changePlan`, a successful provider price update followed by a local
 *   write failure triggers `compensatePlanChange` back to the previous price.
 * - **Side effects:** External Stripe API calls (create / update / cancel /
 *   resume / compensations) and writes to `billing.subscriptions`.
 * - **Notes:** Stripe network calls MUST stay outside the database context to
 *   avoid blocking a Postgres connection on remote I/O. Idempotency for
 *   `create` is forwarded to Stripe via `idempotencyKey` (the
