/**
 * Route-policy regression for the audit domain — the sibling of the files that already pin
 * auth, user, billing/subscription, tenancy/membership, tenancy/organization, and upload.
 *
 * Audit was the last routed domain whose route file carried no `config` block at all: its one
 * registration declared `onRequest`, `preHandler`, and `schema` and fell back to the global
 * limiter. `GET /logs` is a cursor-paginated read over an append-only, unbounded-growth ledger
 * with an opt-in `include_total` count(*) — cheap to issue, expensive to serve, and reachable
 * in a loop by any holder of a valid SUPER_ADMIN / ADMIN token.
 *
 * Enforced textually against the route file rather than at runtime because Fastify's per-route
 * `config` is buried behind plugin encapsulation. The check is brace-balanced rather than
 * regex-terminated so a nested `schema: { ... }` block cannot truncate the extracted options
 * object and hide a dropped preset.
