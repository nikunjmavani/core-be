 * the bare job `name:`, never workflow-prefixed), and the `quality-gate` job `needs:` the
 * `rls-security` lane — so a red RLS run fails the aggregate and blocks the merge. These assertions
 * fail if the ruleset drops `Quality gate`, or the aggregator stops depending on `rls-security`
 * (either would silently un-gate RLS). The generic ruleset ↔ needs invariant is pinned by
