/**
 * Policy: the cross-domain audit surface is a PINNED, reviewed set.
 *
 * Audit emission is deliberately narrow — the audit domain owns the log tables,
 * and only a handful of places outside it may import `@/domains/audit/*`
 * (the composition plugin that wires the container, plus the two features that
 * expose or emit audit data). Pinning the set exactly means:
 *
 * - REMOVING an import (dropping an audit trail or the audit-log endpoint) is a
 *   visible, deliberate change — an audit trail cannot vanish in a refactor.
 * - ADDING an import (a new audit emission or read surface) gets reviewed here
 *   instead of growing silently.
 *
 * Same pattern as `public-route-allowlist.global.test.ts`: exact-set equality,
 * so drift in either direction fails.
