/**
 * Regression guard for the member-search SECURITY DEFINER resolver
 * (`tenancy.search_organization_membership_ids`, migration 20260702000000).
 *
 * Server-side member search matches on the member's user email / name, which live in `auth.users` —
 * a FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY table behind a self-owner policy keyed on `app.current_user_id`. The
 * members list runs under ORG-only context (`app.current_organization_id` set, `app.current_user_id`
 * NOT set), so under the non-superuser `core_be_app` role a plain join from `tenancy.memberships`
 * to `auth.users` resolves the auth.users policy to NULL and returns ZERO rows — search would
 * silently match nothing in production while passing under the RLS-exempt CI superuser. The resolver
 * bypasses RLS by explicit organization scoping.
 *
 * These tests run as `core_be_app` precisely because the local/CI default superuser is RLS-exempt
 * and would hide the bug. If the resolver is dropped or the repository reverts to a raw join, the
 * "definer returns the match" assertion fails.
