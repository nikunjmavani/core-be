/**
 * Regression guard for the non-superuser RLS lane itself.
 *
 * Every other RLS security test means something ONLY if `core_be_app` is genuinely a non-superuser,
 * non-BYPASSRLS role: otherwise `SET LOCAL ROLE core_be_app` is a no-op, the whole lane passes, and
 * production — which runs as this role — is exposed. The org-mandated-MFA bypass was this class of
 * failure (a FORCE-RLS table resolving to zero rows under the app role, read as "no MFA required").
 *
 * The baseline created the role with a bare `CREATE ROLE core_be_app NOLOGIN;`, relying on Postgres
 * defaults; migration `20260603150000_core_be_app_role_least_privilege.sql` pins the posture
 * explicitly. These tests fail if a future change ever grants the app role SUPERUSER or BYPASSRLS —
 * structurally (its `pg_roles` attributes) AND behaviorally (it can still be RLS-blocked to zero
 * rows). Either alone would be enough to silently neuter the entire RLS suite.
