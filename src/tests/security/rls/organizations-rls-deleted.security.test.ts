 *
 * Before this migration, the `USING` clause was:

 *   OR app.global_retention_cleanup = 'true'
 *
 * A request with `X-Organization-Id` set to a deleted org's `public_id` could
 * still read the organizations row directly. The fix adds `AND deleted_at IS NULL`
 * to the tenant-scoped arm so soft-deleted orgs are invisible to HTTP requests.
 * The `global_retention_cleanup` bypass arm is unchanged — retention workers must
 * be able to see deleted rows for tombstone / hard-delete jobs.
