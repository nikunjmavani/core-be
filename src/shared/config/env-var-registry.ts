/**
 * Declarative env-var registry DSL. Each variable is declared once as
 * `envVar(<zod field>, { allowed, description })`, pairing its validation (the Zod schema — the
 * allowed-values authority) with a human-readable allowed-values summary and a one-line description.
 * The runtime Zod object is DERIVED from the registry via {@link toSchemaShape}, so the manifest is
 * the single source of truth for what a variable accepts, defaults to, and means.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The Zod field is written INLINE (not generated from primitives) so precise output-type inference is
 * fully preserved — `getEnv().PORT` stays `number`, an `.optional()` field stays `T | undefined`.
 * Migrating an existing field is therefore a mechanical wrap that never changes validation behaviour:
 * `PORT: z.coerce.number()...` → `PORT: envVar(z.coerce.number()..., { allowed, description })`.
