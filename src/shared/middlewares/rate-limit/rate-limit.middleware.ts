/**
 * Global rate limiting, keyed strictly on `request.ip`.
 *
 * This limiter runs in the `onRequest` phase, before route authentication (which happens
 * in a later `preHandler` via `app.authenticate`). The only tenant signal available here is
 * the request-asserted `X-Organization-Id` header/path, which is NOT yet verified against
 * the caller's membership. Keying on that value would let an unauthenticated client rotate a
 * fresh org id per request to mint a new bucket (bypassing the per-IP cap) or reuse a victim
 * org's id to burn its shared bucket (cross-tenant throttling). It is therefore IP-only.
 *
 * Org- and user-scoped quotas are applied per route in a post-auth `preHandler` via the
 * presets in `rate-limit-presets.constants.ts` (e.g. `ORGANIZATION_SCOPED_AUTHED_RATE_LIMIT`),
 * where `request.auth` and route authorization gate access before the key is derived.
 *
 * @remarks
 * **Fail-over to per-process limiting on Redis error (not full fail-open).** The shared Redis
 * client uses `enableOfflineQueue: false`, so during a Redis blip (failover, maintenance, brief
 * network partition) a raw Redis store's `incr` rejects immediately. Rather than `skipOnError`
 * alone — which would leave the API completely unmetered during the outage — the limiter uses
 * {@link createRedisFallbackRateLimitStore}: Redis errors transparently degrade to an in-process
 * fixed-window counter, so a per-instance cap still applies while Redis is down. `skipOnError`
 * remains set as a last-resort guard (the fallback store does not throw, so a Redis blip can
 * never turn `/livez` / `/readyz` and every other request into a 5xx).
 *
 * The trade-off is **reduced precision over availability**: the local fallback caps throughput
 * per process (not cluster-wide), which is preferable to either a blanket outage or unmetered
 * traffic. Defense in depth is preserved by (1) the per-route auth-gated presets, (2) the Redis
 * client's `error` event handler which logs `redis.connection.error` for alerting, the
 * `rate_limit.redis_failover.local` warning emitted while degraded, and (3) the idempotency
 * middleware which intentionally fail-closes for write safety.
 *
 * Wrapped with `fastify-plugin` so `@fastify/rate-limit` decorates the root app rather than an
 * encapsulated child context. This is required for two reasons: (1) the `global: true` limiter's
 * `onRequest` hook must apply to every route (and run before `organizationRlsTransactionMiddleware`
 * so throttled requests never open a DB transaction), and (2) per-route presets that build a second
 * limiter via `app.rateLimit(...)` (e.g. the per-email throttle in `auth.routes.ts`) need the
 * `rateLimit` decorator visible at the instance where routes register.
