 * - **Failure modes:** none — this is a compatibility stub for the lifecycle coordinator.
 * - **Side effects:** none.

 *   `no_transaction` or `committed` (see `request-lifecycle.middleware.ts`).

 * @remarks
 * sec-M4: this plugin used to pin a pooled DB checkout for the duration of
 * the request. Now `withOrganizationDatabaseContext` opens its own short-
 * lived transaction at each call site, so there is nothing for this plugin
 * to do — it registers, owns no hooks, and returns. It is NOT safe to delete
 * yet because `request-lifecycle.middleware.ts` imports
 * {@link OrganizationRlsTransactionSettlementOutcome} from this file and
 * branches on it during `onResponse`. A future cleanup that drops this no-op
 * must also fold the settlement outcome union into the lifecycle middleware,
 * or inline `'no_transaction'` everywhere it currently flows through this
 * function. Until then the no-op + the outcome union live together so the
 * type and the implementation cannot drift.
