/**
 * Tenant middleware: reads the `X-Organization-Id` header and attaches
 * `request.organizationId`. Validates the format to prevent injection attacks.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The active organization for organization-scoped routes flows from the signed
 * `org` JWT claim (resolved post-auth by `resolveActiveOrganizationId` /
 * `requireOrganizationPermission`), NOT from the URL — routes no longer carry an
 * `{organization_id}` path segment. audit #43: `request.organizationId` set here is
 * effectively DEAD in the authorization path — no production controller reads it for
 * scoping (verified by grep across `src/domains/**`); it is retained only as a
 * pre-auth format-validated decoration and is never the authority for permission
 * checks or the RLS GUC. Do not introduce new consumers that trust it pre-auth.
 *
 * Row-Level Security for Postgres uses `SET LOCAL app.current_organization_id`
 * inside the short-lived `withOrganizationDatabaseContext` transaction opened at
 * each org-scoped call site, keyed by the claim-resolved organization id.
 *
 * **sec-M7 foot-gun**: `request.organizationId` is set on the **`onRequest`**
 * hook — BEFORE authentication runs. The value comes from an
 * attacker-controllable input (the `X-Organization-Id` header) and is NOT a
 * proof of membership. The membership check happens later in
 * `requireOrganizationPermission` (against the token claim). Downstream
 * middlewares MUST NOT trust this field pre-auth — any DB lookup / cache key /
 * RLS GUC keyed on it before authentication is an enumeration / amplification
 * vector (see sec-M1 for an active exploitation of the same pattern).
