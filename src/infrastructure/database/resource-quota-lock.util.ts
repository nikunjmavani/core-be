 * Each value is a distinct ASCII tag so the two-key `pg_advisory_xact_lock(classid, objid)` form
 * keeps every resource type in its own lock space (and never collides with single-key advisory
 * locks like the migration runner). The `objid` is a positive int4 hash of the scope id — the
 * owning user for the owned-organization cap, the organization for the per-organization caps. Only
 * stability matters (the same scope must always map to the same lock).

/**
 * Takes a transaction-scoped advisory lock that serializes resource-creation quota checks for one
 * scope (audit-#8).
 *
 * @remarks
 * - **Algorithm:** `pg_advisory_xact_lock(namespace, objid)` on the request-scoped connection; the
 *   lock auto-releases at COMMIT/ROLLBACK. MUST be acquired inside the same transaction as the
 *   subsequent `count(...) >= cap` check and the insert (e.g. within `withOrganizationDatabaseContext`).
 *   The `objid` is `hashtextextended(key) & 0x7fffffff` — a stable positive int4 hash of the scope
 *   id, so `bigserial` keys beyond int4's 2.1B max can never overflow the int4 `objid` (B-1). A hash
 *   collision only causes harmless extra contention; the count is still independently scope-filtered.
 * - **Failure modes:** blocks until the lock is granted; no application-level timeout (the
 *   surrounding statement timeout bounds it).
 * - **Side effects:** holds a Postgres advisory lock for the remainder of the transaction.
 * - **Notes:** closes the count-then-insert race where concurrent create requests each pass the
 *   same pre-check before any row is inserted and overshoot the configured cap.
