# Worker scaling runbook

BullMQ workers run as a **separate process** (`node dist/worker.js` / `Dockerfile.worker`). Scale workers independently of the API.

## When to scale out

| Signal                         | Action                                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Queue depth growing steadily   | Add worker replicas (same `REDIS_URL`, `DATABASE_URL`)                           |
| Job latency p95 above SLO      | Scale workers or tune `WORKER_CONCURRENCY` per queue                             |
| CPU pegged on worker container | Horizontal scale before raising per-process concurrency                          |
| DLQ depth alerts               | Fix root cause first; see [bull-board.md](../../reference/runtime/bull-board.md) |

## Railway / container notes

- Deploy **API** (`Dockerfile` `api` target) and **worker** (`Dockerfile.worker`) as separate services.
- Worker image has **no HTTP health endpoint** — rely on process exit/restart and queue metrics ([docker-images.md](../docker-images.md)).
- Use the same secrets as the API for `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, Stripe, mail, and Sentry.

## Safe scaling practices

1. **One logical queue name per job type** — do not shard the same queue across incompatible processors.
2. **Pass `organizationPublicId` in tenant-scoped job payloads** — workers set `app.current_organization_id` via `withOrganizationContext` / `runTenantScopedWorkerJob`, not HTTP middleware. Unpinned DB access in the worker process throws `WorkerDatabaseContextError` at runtime.
3. **System tables without tenant RLS** (`auth.mail_outbox`, `billing.stripe_webhook_events`) — use `withSystemTableWorkerContext` in processors; see [workers-and-events.md](../../reference/runtime/workers-and-events.md).
4. **Redis key prefix** — parallel agents or environments must use distinct `REDIS` namespaces to avoid queue collisions.
5. **Graceful shutdown** — workers honor SIGTERM; allow drain time before force-kill during deploys.

## Splitting worker services by family

Workers are grouped into six families in the [worker registry](../../reference/runtime/workers-and-events.md#worker-registry-and-queue-families): `mail`, `notify`, `webhook`, `stripe`, `retention`, `observability`. `WORKER_QUEUE_FAMILIES` (default `all` = monolithic) selects which families a process runs.

| When to split                                              | Why                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Monolithic worker exceeds `DATABASE_POOL_MAX`              | Default demand is ~38 Postgres slots; splitting reduces per-process demand and avoids contention.                       |
| Retention crons compete with throughput jobs at peak hours | Isolate `retention` to its own service so audit/tombstone runs do not steal connections from `mail`/`webhook`/`stripe`. |
| Need to size memory or replicas differently per workload   | Throughput families benefit from more replicas; retention typically needs only one replica.                             |

Recommended layout (see [resource-limits.md → Example Railway split](resource-limits.md#example-railway-split-same-image-different-env-per-service) for pool sizing):

| Service                | `WORKER_QUEUE_FAMILIES`      | `SCHEDULER_ENABLED` | Notes                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `worker-throughput`    | `mail,notify,webhook,stripe` | `false`             | Horizontal-scale freely; replicas multiply pool demand.                          |
| `worker-retention`     | `retention`                  | `true`              | Run **one replica** — cron jobs are not idempotent across overlapping processes. |
| `worker-observability` | `observability`              | `true`              | Redis-only; tiny resource footprint.                                             |

`SCHEDULER_ENABLED=true` on **exactly one service** per environment registers the BullMQ repeatable jobs. The scheduler in each process only registers crons for queues whose workers are active in that process, so a misconfigured second scheduler-bearing service is bounded but still wasteful — keep the contract clean.

Adding a new worker is a one-line entry in `worker-registration.registry.ts` with a `family` choice; `bootstrap.ts`, `scheduler.ts`, and `assertPostgresConnectionBudget()` pick it up automatically.
