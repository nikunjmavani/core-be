# SQL migrations (core-be)

How schema changes ship, how CI guards them, and how to validate **rollback** without applying destructive DDL in production.

---

## Layout

| Path | Role |
| ---- | ---- |
| `migrations/*.sql` | Ordered, forward-only SQL applied by `pnpm db:migrate` |
| `src/domains/**/<resource>.schema.ts` | Drizzle definitions — must stay aligned with migrations |
| `src/scripts/validators/migration/lint-migrations.ts` | CI gate (`pnpm db:migrate:lint`) — destructive DDL, RLS, naming |

See **db-migration-maintainer** skill and [data-lifecycle-deletion.md](../data/data-lifecycle-deletion.md) when retention or `deleted_at` changes.

### Source of truth — no Drizzle Kit snapshot in `migrations/`

The authoritative migration set is the hand-written, **timestamp-named** `migrations/*.sql` files, applied by `pnpm db:migrate` (`src/infrastructure/database/migration/migrate.ts`) and recorded in the `public.schema_migrations` table. Drizzle Kit's snapshot/journal (`meta/_journal.json`, `*_snapshot.json`) are **not** part of this — they use a sequential `0000`/`0001` index that collides when two developers branch in parallel, which is the exact problem the timestamp prefix avoids.

`drizzle.config.ts` therefore points `out` at `./drizzle/` (gitignored scratch). `pnpm db:generate` is a **drafting aid only**: it writes a full diff there; copy what you need into a `pnpm db:migrate:new <slug>` file and discard the scratch output. Never commit a `migrations/meta/` folder, and never apply from `./drizzle/`.

## Migration filename ordering

Each up migration file is named `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_snake_case.sql`. The **14-digit prefix is a real UTC wall-clock timestamp** (`YYYYMMDDHHMMSS`), not a counter. Using the actual time of day means two developers branching off the same dev tip naturally land on different prefixes and avoid the trivial merge conflict that comes from sequential `_000001 / _000002` suffixes.

- Applied migrations are recorded in `public.schema_migrations` by **filename** — never rename merged files. Renaming makes the runner treat the file as a new migration and re-apply it in environments that already had it.
- The prefix must be **strictly greater** than every existing up migration (`pnpm db:migrate:lint` enforces monotonic order).
- Historical mixes (e.g. `202502*` early schema, then `202605*` with `_000001` counter suffixes) are valid; ordering is by prefix only. Leave existing files alone.
- **Do not** rely on `date -u +%Y%m%d000001` or any other counter pattern — that re-introduces the merge-conflict problem. Use the generator below.

**Create a new migration (preferred):**

```bash
pnpm db:migrate:new add_my_table
# → creates migrations/<YYYYMMDDHHMMSS>_add_my_table.sql with a header template
```

**Inspect the next prefix without creating a file:**

```bash
pnpm db:migrate:next-prefix add_my_table
# → prints current max, next prefix, and example filename
```

Both helpers share the same logic: prefer real UTC `HHMMSS`, fall back to incrementing the current max only when "now" is not strictly greater (clock skew, or two migrations created in the same second). Author SQL in the generated file and run `pnpm db:migrate:lint`.

---

## Forward apply (local / CI)

```bash
pnpm db:migrate:lint   # safety rules
pnpm db:migrate        # apply pending files
pnpm db:migrate:dry-run  # print SQL without applying (when debugging)
```

CI and `pnpm verify:base` run migrate against ephemeral Postgres before API smoke tests.

## Non-transactional migrations (`CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`)

By default the runner wraps **each migration file in a single transaction** — DML and most DDL apply atomically and roll back automatically on a mid-file error. A few statements cannot run inside a transaction, most importantly `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`, which is the zero-downtime way to add an index: plain `CREATE INDEX` takes a `SHARE` lock that **blocks all writes** for the build duration (minutes on a large high-write table such as `audit.logs`).

Opt a migration into the non-transactional lane with a header in the first 20 lines, and separate **every** statement with `--> statement-breakpoint` so the runner sends each one to Postgres independently:

```sql
-- migration-transaction: none reason="CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY cannot run inside a transaction"

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_audit_logs_org_created_id
  ON audit.logs (organization_id, created_at, id);
--> statement-breakpoint

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_notifications_user_created_id
  ON notify.notifications (user_id, created_at, id);
```

Rules and guardrails (enforced by `pnpm db:migrate:lint`):

- **`CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` requires** the `migration-transaction: none` header — otherwise it would fail at apply time inside the wrapping transaction (`concurrent_index_requires_non_transactional`, **non-overridable**).
- **Separate every statement with `--> statement-breakpoint`.** The runner sends each breakpoint segment as one command; two statements in a segment form an implicit transaction, and `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` cannot run inside one. The linter flags a segment that holds more than one statement (`non_transactional_statements_need_breakpoints`, **non-overridable**).
- **Every statement must be idempotent** (`IF NOT EXISTS`). There is no enclosing transaction, so a statement that fails mid-file is not rolled back; re-running `pnpm db:migrate` re-executes the file from the top.
- **One concern per file.** Keep non-transactional migrations to index DDL only; put DML and constraint changes in separate (transactional) migrations.
- After a non-transactional migration, the runner **checks for `INVALID` / unready indexes** (the signature of a concurrent build that aborted) and refuses to record the migration as applied. If this fires, drop the broken index (`DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF EXISTS <schema>.<name>`) and re-run `pnpm db:migrate`.

### Append-heavy tables (`audit.logs`, `notify.notifications`)

These tables are **plain (non-partitioned)** tables. Growth is bounded by row-level retention workers (`audit-retention`, `notification-retention`) that batch-`DELETE` rows older than the configured window — there is no partition lifecycle to maintain. New indexes on these tables follow the same rules as any other high-write table: prefer `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` in a non-transactional migration. The composite keyset indexes added in [`20260520000006_keyset_pagination_indexes.sql`](../../../migrations/20260520000006_keyset_pagination_indexes.sql) were created with a plain `CREATE INDEX` only because the baseline seeds those tables empty (instant build, before any live traffic).

### Expand / contract (keep deploys backward-compatible)

Production runs `pnpm db:migrate` **before** the new application version is rolled out, while the old version still serves traffic. Schema changes must therefore stay compatible with the **currently running** code:

1. **Expand** — add the new index/column/table (additive, backward-compatible). Index additions go in a `migration-transaction: none` migration so writes are never blocked.
2. **Migrate code** — deploy the version that reads/writes the new shape.
3. **Contract** — in a *later* migration (after the old version is fully gone), drop the now-unused column/constraint.

## Rollback testing approach

Production deploys are **forward-only**: we do not run automatic down migrations on Railway. Rollback validation is done **before merge** using one of these patterns:

### 1. Neon branch rehearsal (recommended)

1. Create a disposable Neon branch from production (or staging) schema.
2. Apply the PR migration: `DATABASE_URL=<branch> pnpm db:migrate`.
3. Run targeted Vitest integration tests and `pnpm test:api-smoke` against the branch.
4. **Simulate rollback** by restoring the branch to a PITR timestamp **before** the migration (Neon console) or by creating a fresh branch from the old snapshot.
5. Redeploy application code at the **previous git tag** against the restored branch and re-run smoke tests.

This validates **RPO/RTO** assumptions in [dr-runbook.md](../../process/dr-runbook.md) without mutating production.

### 2. Local two-step apply

1. `pnpm compose:up && pnpm compose:wait`
2. Migrate to revision *N*: `pnpm db:migrate`
3. Capture schema dump: `pg_dump --schema-only … > /tmp/before.sql`
4. Apply revision *N+1* (the PR migration).
5. Confirm app tests pass at *N+1*.
6. **Logical rollback**: reset DB (`docker compose down -v`, up, migrate only through *N*) and confirm the previous app commit still works — proves the old code path does not require new columns.

### 3. Compensating migration (production rollback)

When a migration already reached production and must be reversed:

1. Ship a **new** forward migration that undoes the effect (drop column added in error, restore constraint, etc.).
2. Never edit merged `migrations/*.sql` files.
3. Run `pnpm db:migrate:lint` with explicit `--allow-destructive` only when architect-approved.

## Transaction rollback (CI)

Postgres transaction rollback for multi-write helpers is covered in CI by:

```bash
pnpm test:integration:transaction-rollback
```

(`src/tests/integration/database/transaction-rollback.integration.test.ts` — asserts `withTransaction` rolls back on error and commits on success.) This is **not** SQL migration rollback.

---

## Automated migration rollback test stub (future)

A dedicated Vitest project (`migrations-rollback`) is **not** wired in CI today — Neon branch rehearsal is the supported path. If we add automation later, it should:

- Spin up Testcontainers Postgres
- Apply `migrations/` through file *N*, run a minimal schema assertion
- Apply *N+1*, assert new invariant
- Reset volume and re-apply through *N* only, assert old invariant

Until then, document rollback evidence in the PR (Neon branch name + smoke command output).

## ER diagram (dbdiagram.io)

Regenerate [DBML](https://dbml.dbdiagram.io/docs) from **all** `migrations/*.sql` (replay in filename order):

```bash
pnpm tool:generate-dbdiagram
```

Output: [`docs/database/core-be.dbml`](../../database/core-be.dbml) — import at [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/) (File → Import).

The file includes:

- **Primary keys** (`pk`, `increment`, and composite `indexes { ... [pk] }` where defined)
- **Foreign keys** as `Ref:` lines with `delete: cascade | restrict | set null` where defined in SQL
- **RLS** as per-table `Note` blocks (policies from `CREATE POLICY` migrations)
- **TableGroup** per Postgres schema (`auth`, `tenancy`, `billing`, …)

Dropped tables from earlier schema consolidations are omitted from the cumulative model — Stripe is the source of truth for billing documents and payment instruments.
