# Audit logs

Core-be records security-relevant mutations in `audit.logs` via `recordScopedAuditEvent` (controllers) and `recordAuditEvent` (infrastructure). Writes are **best-effort**: failures are logged and must not fail the HTTP request.

## Query API

- `GET /api/v1/tenancy/organizations/:id/audit-logs` — requires `audit-log:read`, scoped by organization (`withOrganizationDatabaseContext`).
- `GET /api/v1/audit/logs` — global admin only (`SUPER_ADMIN` / `ADMIN`); cross-tenant listing runs under `withGlobalAdminDatabaseContext` (`app.global_admin = true`) so FORCE RLS / `core_be_app` see all tenants explicitly.

## Action naming

Actions use dot-separated names: `<domain>.<resource>.<verb>`.

## Row shape

- `actor_user_id` — resolved from JWT `userId` (public id).
- `organization_id` — set when the mutation is org-scoped (resolved from `X-Organization-Id` path param).
- `metadata` — public ids and non-PII context (no passwords or tokens). The list API runs `sanitizeAuditLogMetadata` so internal numeric `*_id` keys (except `*_public_id`), underscore-prefixed keys, and credential-like fields are stripped from responses.

## Storage & partitioning

`audit.logs` is created by the migrations as a **plain table** (`id bigserial PRIMARY KEY`) — this
is the committed schema, and a fresh clone or deploy reproduces it exactly.

High-volume **hosted** environments may RANGE-partition `audit.logs` by `created_at` (e.g. monthly
partitions) for cheaper retention pruning and time-windowed scans. That partitioning is applied
**out-of-band** (infra / DBA) and is intentionally **not** in the repo migrations, because it would
change the table shape everywhere: a partitioned table must include the partition key in its
primary key (`(id, created_at)` instead of `id`) and needs an ongoing partition-creation mechanism.

The application works with **either** shape:

- Reads and writes are keyed on `created_at` + `id` (the keyset-pagination indexes already cover this).
- Retention cleanup deletes by `created_at` window — equally valid against a plain table or by dropping old partitions.
- The FK migration [`20260601120000_audit_logs_actor_api_key.sql`](../../../migrations/20260601120000_audit_logs_actor_api_key.sql) adds its foreign key already-validated (not `NOT VALID`), because Postgres rejects `ADD FOREIGN KEY … NOT VALID` on a partitioned table (error 42809).

If you operate at a scale that needs partitioning, apply it in your environment's provisioning
(composite PK + initial partitions + a partition-creation job); the repo does not manage it.
