# Authorization coverage & gap map (all routes)

> Point-in-time analysis derived from `docs/routes.txt` + `tooling/openapi/route-catalog/route-authorization-model.json`. Generated 2026-06-15.

Answers "is every route — organization-level included — covered, and what is **not** in the codebase/tests yet?" Companion to [`authorization-testing-plan.md`](./authorization-testing-plan.md).

**Total routes: 131.** Every route is classified into one authorization bucket below; the "Gap" column states what is missing.

## Coverage at a glance

| Bucket | Count | Guard (in code) | Tested by | Gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `auth-by-id` | 13 | Ownership filter / user RLS / email-match | object-ownership + invitation-email (Phase 2 matrix) | ✅ cross-user/email BOLA e2e for every by-id route |
| `org-by-id` | 28 | Org permission + org RLS | permission-route-matrix (BFLA) + cross-org-resource/cross-org-mutation (Phase 2) | ✅ cross-org BOLA e2e for every by-id route (read + write) |
| `org-collection` | 22 | Org permission middleware | permission-route-matrix (every PERM route) | ✅ BFLA; grant-grantability on creates only partially asserted |
| `global-role` | 9 | JWT global role claim | admin-only (every `/users/:user_id` route) + privilege-escalation | ✅ all 5 user-by-id admin routes asserted; collection `/users`, audit, mcp still sampled |
| `auth-self-mutation` | 24 | Auth; acts on caller (/me) | auth-enforcement (401), mass-assignment (subset) | ⚠ caller-scoped; no per-route assertion |
| `auth-self-list` | 12 | Auth; results scoped to caller | auth-enforcement (401) | ✅ low risk (caller-scoped list) |
| `public` | 20 | None (some need X-Captcha-Token / Stripe-Signature) | public-routes, captcha, oauth-callback, stripe-webhook | ⚠ business-flow abuse (API6) not systematically tested |
| `bearer-token` | 3 | Service/metrics token | api-key-auth, ops route tests | ✅ low |

## What is NOT in the codebase / tests yet

> **Reconciliation with integration tests:** the per-domain `*.integration` suites already cover more than the dedicated `security/` suite. For example `membership.integration` asserts cross-org `404` (invitation revoke/resend, membership-permission lookup), owner-tier `403` (`transfer-ownership`, owner-cannot-leave), and email-match `403` (decline someone else's invitation). The gaps below are what remains **after** counting those.

1. ~~**Cross-user (intra-tenant) BOLA — `auth-by-id`.**~~ **RESOLVED (Phase 2).** `object-ownership.security.test.ts` denies User B every User A object (uploads, notifications, data-export, sessions/MFA/auth-methods under step-up) with `verifyNoMutation`; `invitation-email.security.test.ts` covers the email-bound accept/decline.
2. ~~**Cross-org BOLA e2e — `org-by-id` resources.**~~ **RESOLVED (Phase 2).** `cross-org-resource.security.test.ts` (reads → 404 + same-org 200) and `cross-org-mutation.security.test.ts` (writes → 404, incl. subscription/api-key/notification-policy/webhook/role/membership/invitation) cover every org-by-id route.
3. **Grant-grantability on create paths.** The role-permission **PUT** is now e2e-asserted (`tier-and-grant.security.test.ts`: a manager cannot grant a permission they do not hold, and cannot reach across orgs). Residual: create paths (`POST roles`, `POST invitations`, api-key scopes) are not all asserted at the route level.
4. **Global-role denial — `global-role`.** **RESOLVED for the by-id surface (Phase 2):** `admin-only.security.test.ts` asserts a regular user is denied on all five `/users/:user_id` admin routes (GET/PATCH/DELETE/suspend/unsuspend). Residual: the collection `GET /users`, `audit/logs`, and `mcp` admin routes are still only sampled.
5. **Caller-scope on `auth-self-mutation` (24 routes).** Guarded by auth + `/me` scoping, but there is no per-route assertion that the body cannot redirect the action to another user (mass-assignment covers a subset only).
6. **Business-flow abuse (OWASP API6) on `public`/auth flows.** Rate-limit + captcha exist; multi-step flow abuse (e.g. invitation/checkout sequencing) is not systematically tested.
7. **Spec validity.** The generated OpenAPI sets `example`+`examples` together and uses PCRE-lookahead `pattern`s — invalid for strict (RE2) parsers. Worth fixing in the spec generator so the spec is portable to strict tooling, not just Swagger UI.

## How the gaps close

- **Phase 1 (done):** `route-authorization-model.json` (48 entries) declares the model for every object-by-id protected route; `authz-model-coverage.global.test.ts` fails CI if a by-id route is added without a model entry.
- **Phase 2 (done):** the matrix in `src/tests/security/authz/` (80 tests, 7 suites) asserts attacker outcomes e2e (cross-user, cross-org read + write, tier, grant, email, global-role) with `verifyNoMutation`. `authz-runtime-coverage.global.test.ts` now fails CI if a modelled route lacks a mapped runtime attack test — so gaps 1, 2, 4 cannot silently reappear. Closes gaps 1–2 and 4 (by-id surface).
- **Phase 3 (next):** caller-scope assertions for `auth-self-mutation` (gap 5), grant-grantability on create paths (gap 3 residual), and business-flow abuse (gap 6).
