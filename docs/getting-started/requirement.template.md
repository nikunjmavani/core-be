# Requirement intake form (core-be)

This is the **one format** `/build-requirement` expects. Copy the form in **The form**
below, fill every section, and run **`/build-requirement`** (paste it, or pass a path).
You fill this form; the command builds the full production-ready vertical slice from it
and emits a reports bundle.

## How to fill it

- Keep the `## N.` headings exactly as written — they are the sections the build reads.
- Every field has an example on the next line starting with `# e.g.` — **replace the
  `<...>` placeholder with your value**; leave the `# e.g.` line as a guide or delete it.
- If a section truly doesn't apply, write `none`. Anything you mark `default` uses the
  **Default assumptions** in [`requirement-intake.md`](requirement-intake.md).
- `/build-requirement` is best-effort: for any field left as a `<...>` placeholder or
  ambiguous, it asks you once to fill it — it never guesses the data model, auth, or tenancy.

## The form (copy this)

```markdown
# Requirement: <one-line title>
# e.g. Organization invoices

## 1. Summary & placement
- Purpose: <what + why, 1–2 lines>
  # e.g. Let organization admins list and fetch their billing invoices.
- Domain / sub-domain: <domain> / <sub-domain> (new or existing)
  # e.g. billing / invoice (new sub-domain under the existing billing domain)
- Depends on / related: <other domains, services, or features | none>
  # e.g. reads tenancy.organization; no cross-domain writes

## 2. Data model
- Need tables? <yes/no>
  # e.g. yes
- Table(s): <snake_case plural name(s) | none>
  # e.g. invoices
- Columns: <name: type, notNull?, default?, unique?, FK?>  (use text, never varchar)
  # e.g. organization_id: bigint, notNull, FK organizations.id
  # e.g. amount_cents: bigint, notNull
  # e.g. currency: text, notNull, default 'usd'
  # e.g. status: text, notNull   (CHECK status in ('draft','open','paid','void'))
  # e.g. issued_at: timestamptz, notNull
- Public-id prefix: <short token>
  # e.g. inv   ->  external id looks like inv_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k
- Relations / indexes: <FKs, composite/unique indexes | none>
  # e.g. index (organization_id, issued_at desc); unique (organization_id, number)
- Tenancy / soft-delete / audit: <org-scoped? RLS? soft-delete? audit?>
  # e.g. org-scoped, RLS on (USING + WITH CHECK app.current_organization_id) | soft-delete: no (immutable ledger) | audit: created_at only

## 3. Public API
- Endpoints: <METHOD /api/v1/<path> — purpose>  (snake_case semantic params like {invoice_id})
  # e.g. GET /api/v1/billing/invoices — list the org's invoices
  # e.g. GET /api/v1/billing/invoices/{invoice_id} — get one invoice
  # e.g. POST /api/v1/billing/invoices — create an invoice
- Auth per route: <public | authenticated | org-permission:<code> | global-role:admin>
  # e.g. org-permission:billing.read on GET, billing.write on POST
- Request body (snake_case + validation): <fields | none>
  # e.g. POST { amount_cents: integer > 0, currency: 'usd'|'eur', due_at?: ISO-8601 }
- Response (serialized; external id is `id`): <fields>
  # e.g. { id, amount_cents, currency, status, issued_at, created_at }
- Statuses / headers / pagination: <success + errors | headers | cursor?>
  # e.g. 200 list/get, 201 create, 403 no-permission, 404 not-found, 422 missing X-Idempotency-Key | X-Idempotency-Key required on POST | cursor pagination on list

## 4. Business logic
- Service intent per operation: <what each operation does>
  # e.g. listInvoices({ organizationId, cursor }); getInvoice({ organizationId, invoiceId }); createInvoice({ organizationId, input })
- Transactions / cross-domain (via services, never repositories): <... | none>
  # e.g. createInvoice wraps the insert in withTransaction; reads billing.subscription service for the active plan
- Events / workers: <event, queue, payload, behavior | none>
  # e.g. emit BILLING_EVENT.INVOICE_CREATED -> notify webhook delivery; queue invoice-delivery; payload { invoicePublicId, organizationPublicId }
- Idempotency / caching / rate limits: <which writes | none>
  # e.g. POST create is idempotencyRequired (X-Idempotency-Key); no caching; default rate limit

## 5. i18n
- Message keys + English copy (errors.* / success.*): <keys | none>
  # e.g. errors.invoice_not_found "Invoice not found."
  # e.g. success.invoice_created "Invoice created."

## 6. Seed data
- Reference rows (idempotent, minimal): <... | none>
  # e.g. none
- Bulk / faker rows: <... | none>
  # e.g. 20 invoices per seeded organization with random status and amount

## 7. Tests — which layers do you need? (yes/no; defaults in [])
- Unit (validators / serializers / pure services) [yes]: <cases>
  # e.g. yes — validator rejects amount_cents <= 0; serializer exposes id, hides internal pk
- Integration (repository ↔ DB) [yes if data model]: <cases | none>
  # e.g. yes — repo.listByOrganization returns only the org's rows, ordered by issued_at
- E2E (fastify.inject route tests) [yes]: <happy + edge cases>
  # e.g. list 200 paginated; get 200; another org's invoice 404; no permission 403; bad cursor 400
- Smoke (live pnpm verify:base after seed) [yes]: <endpoints to hit>
  # e.g. GET /api/v1/billing/invoices returns 200 with a seeded org token
- Contract (Stripe / Resend / S3 via nock) [yes if external calls]: <... | none>
  # e.g. none — no outbound calls
- Chaos (Toxiproxy fault injection) [no]: <... | none>
  # e.g. none

## 8. Non-functionals
- Observability: <logs / metrics / sentry>
  # e.g. log invoice.created with organization_id; counter invoices_created_total
- Performance budget: <targets>
  # e.g. list p95 < 100ms at 10k invoices per org
- Security: <tenant isolation / secrets / PII>
  # e.g. RLS enforces org isolation; no PII beyond the org link; amounts are not secrets

## 9. File structure & deliverables (what the build will create — adjust if needed)
- Schema + migration:
  # e.g. src/domains/billing/sub-domains/invoice/invoice.schema.ts
  # e.g. migrations/<timestamp>_create_invoices.sql
- Layers (sub-domain): repository, service, controller, dto, validator, serializer, types
  # e.g. src/domains/billing/sub-domains/invoice/invoice.{repository,service,controller,dto,validator,serializer,types}.ts
- Routes + DI wiring:
  # e.g. invoice routes added to billing.routes.ts; wired in billing.container.ts
- Tests:
  # e.g. src/domains/billing/__tests__/billing.test.ts (e2e) + sub-domains/invoice/__tests__/unit/
- Seed:
  # e.g. src/domains/billing/sub-domains/invoice/seed/ (reference + bulk + faker)
- Docs:
  # e.g. OVERVIEW.md for invoice; route schema summary/description/tags; OpenAPI; TSDoc on every export
- Reports bundle:
  # e.g. docs/builds/<date>-organization-invoices/ (build-report, traceability, review, quality)
```
