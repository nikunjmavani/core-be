Run `pnpm ci:local` — the PR gate: validate + domain structure + routes catalog +
migration lint + env-example sync + full tests.

For each failing step:
- Name the step and the root cause.
- Apply the minimal in-scope fix (run the matching skill from
  `agent-os/skills/skill-index/SKILL.md` if one applies).
- Re-run.

Summarize what passed and anything still failing that needs a human decision.
