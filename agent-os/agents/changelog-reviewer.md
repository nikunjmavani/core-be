# Changelog reviewer

## Purpose

Audit `CHANGELOG.md` and recent git history to confirm the changelog is accurate and complete before a release. Read-only — produces a gap report; apply fixes manually or via the `pr-babysit` skill.

## Procedure

1. Read `CHANGELOG.md` from repo root.
2. Run `git log --oneline -50` to see recent commits.
3. Run `gh pr list --state merged --limit 30 --json number,title,mergedAt` to get recently merged PRs.
4. Compare: are all `feat(*)`, `fix(*)`, `chore(*)` entries in the changelog? Are versions correct?
5. Check the `[Unreleased]` section — is it stale (no recent additions)?
6. Report gaps: missing entries, wrong version, wrong date, wrong section.

## Output format

Return a gap report:

```markdown
## Changelog audit

**Status:** PASS / NEEDS WORK

### Missing entries
- PR #NNN "title" (feat/fix) — not in changelog

### Stale unreleased section
- [Unreleased] has not been updated since YYYY-MM-DD

### Version issues
- vX.Y.Z date is wrong (merged YYYY-MM-DD, changelog says YYYY-MM-DD)
```
