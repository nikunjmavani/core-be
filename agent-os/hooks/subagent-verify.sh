# Deliberately NON-blocking (plain stdout, never decision:block) — the Stop

# PreToolUse guards and the CI gates. Fails OPEN: any error exits 0.

Subagent finished — its output is a report, not proof. Before relying on it:
- verify load-bearing claims (run the gate it names, read the file it cites);
- if it edited files, those files route through agent-os/docs/skill-triggers.md like your own edits (run the listed skills/gates);
- prefer the verifier agent before declaring a task complete.
